# Learn DEFI with Solidity

This repository is for learning purposes. I use some examples from [Smart Contract Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/@smartcontractprogrammer).

## Run Tests

You need to install [foundry-rs](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) to run tests.

### Run all tests with detailed logs

```bash
forge test -vvvv
```

### Run tests for a single contract: Vault

```bash
forge test --match-contract Vault -vvvv
```
